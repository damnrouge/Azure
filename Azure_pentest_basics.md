#### Overview
- **Azure RBAC Roles** (Azure Role-Based Access Control) provide access management for Azure resources using Azure Resource Manager (ARM).
- There are over 120 built-in roles (more than 300 as per permissions.cloud), with the option to define custom roles.

#### Four Fundamental Azure Roles

| **Role**              | **Permissions**                          | **Applies On**       |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Owner**             | - Full access to all resources<br>- Can manage access for other users | All resource types   |
| **Contributor**       | - Full access to all resources<br>- Cannot manage access        | All resource types   |
| **Reader**            | - View all resources                     | All resource types   |
| **User Access Administrator** | - View all resources<br>- Can manage access for other users | All resource types   |

### Notes on Azure Architecture – Azure RBAC Assignment

#### Key Concept
- **Azure AD Object/Principal Has Role on Scope**:
  - Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) assignments link an Azure AD object/principal (e.g., User, Group, Service Principal, Managed Identity) to a role within a specific scope.

#### Process Flow
1. **Azure AD Object/Principal**:
   - Can be a User, Group, Service Principal, or Managed Identity.
   
2. **Role Assignment**:
   - The object/principal is assigned a role from a set of roles:
     - Built-in roles: Owner, Contributor, Reader, User Access Administrator, Security Reader, Virtual Machine Contributor, Support Ticket Reader, etc.
     - Custom roles can also be defined.

3. **Scope**:
   - The role is applied to a specific scope, which can be:
     - Management Group
     - Subscription
     - Resource Group
     - Individual Resources
